Welcome to the **SimWorld** Documentation!

Realistic, open-ended, and natively LLM/VLM-compatible simulators are essential for advancing agent development in complex physical and social environments. However, most existing simulators focus on indoor or task-specific domains (e.g., household robotics or autonomous driving), limiting research into large-scale, open-ended scenarios with realistic physical and social dynamics.

SimWorld addresses these limitations by providing a comprehensive platform that combines: 

1. Realistic, Open-Ended World Simulation. 

2. Rich Interface for LLM/VLM Agents. 

3. Diverse Physical and Social Reasoning Scenarios.

With SimWorld, researchers can explore embodied intelligence at scale, enabling agents to perceive, reason, and act in complex, dynamic worlds that closely mirror real-world scenarios.
