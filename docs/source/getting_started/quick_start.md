# Quick Start

This page shows how to download and install the packaged version of SimWorld. The package includes the executable file of SimWorld server and the Python client library.

## Before you begin
The following requirements should be fulfilled before installing SimWorld:

+ System requirements. SimWorld is built for Windows and Linux systems.
+ An adequate GPU. SimWorld aims for realistic simulations, so the server needs at least a 6 GB GPU although we would recommend 8 GB. A dedicated GPU is highly recommended for machine learning.
+ Memory. A 32 GB memory or above is recommended.
+ Disk space. SimWorld will use about 50 GB of space.
+ Python. SimWorld supports Python 3.10 or higher.
+ Two TCP ports and good internet connection. 9000 and 9001 by default. Make sure that these ports are not blocked by firewalls or any other applications.
